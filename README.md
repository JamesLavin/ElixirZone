## About ElixirZone

You can watch ElixirZone episodes at [my ElixirZone Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3-AjDpwo4OZ5sHYxUWFijA).

I'm creating and sharing videos at ElixirZone in hopes of spreading my excitement about [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [OTP](https://github.com/erlang/otp), [Gleam](https://gleam.run/), [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/), [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/), [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html) ([fabulous course with many free episodes](https://pragmaticstudio.com/phoenix-liveview)), and the entire BEAM ecosystem.

You can find more resources on these technologies at [my Github Elixir/Erlang/BEAM page](https://github.com/JamesLavin/my_tech_resources/blob/master/Elixir.markdown).

The Elixir ecosystem is just a subset of the BEAM ecosystem and has enabled tremendous developer productivity and happiness in just a decade since Jose Valim had the brilliant vision to build more developer-friendly syntax, metaprogramming, and tooling atop the powerful, scalable, and battle-tested Erlang, OTP, and BEAM VM. Erlang's implementation of the actor model enables safe, fault-tolerant, scalable, concurrent & parallel programming, which is a game-changer. But developers unfamiliar with concurrent, functional programming need to twist their brains a bit to become comfortable with this paradigm.

I've been very happily programming mostly in Elixir for six or seven years and want to spread our secret and throw open the doors to this fun party.
